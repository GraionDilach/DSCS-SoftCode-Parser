### DSCS SoftCode Parser

Just a tool to convert SimpleDSCSModManager softcodes into something more commonly readable.

Either copy this program to SimpleDSCSModManager/output/softcode_cache, either copy out Digimon.json and DigimonText.json from the above directory next to this executable.

After running this, you'll get 5 CSVs, one for Digimon/DigimonText each, and three additional ones to separate these blocks to having it in both, and having it in one each.
